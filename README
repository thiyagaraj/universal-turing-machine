Description:

This was something I wrote as an exercise one night when I was attending a Finite Automata 
Class during my master's programme at PESIT. I will try to document how it works going 
forward. This was in  2008 and I have lost original documentation. Basically, it will take
a file as input or via command line, and then generate an output.

More documentation coming soon.
